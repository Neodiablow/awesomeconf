Awesomeconf (for awesome 3.5.1)
===========

My awesome config

Here is my personal awesomeWM config, nothing fancy. Please help yourself and copy anything you could find interesting in those files :-).

   :height: 600
   :width: 1200
   :scale: 50
   :alt: Example of the theme

##Remarks
I use MPD if you don't you can remove some big parts of the rc.lua or replace them to suite your own music player.

I use thunar as a file manager (change the mod + e binding if you don't use thunar) _xtrlock_, _URXVT_ as terminal. (change to terminator or urxvtc or others)

I use _wicd_ and htop, they spawns at restart of awesome. 

And of finally I use Vim (emacs lovers should change the default editor).

This theme is still under "developpement".

## INSTALL :
copy themes/ icons/ rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome

copy font to ~/.fonts

if you want to use "alt" instead of "super/windows" you shall modify Mod4 to Mod1

I make an extensive use of MPD in the theme

Finally you might want to remove my personal bindings such as the xtrlock one and the layout keyboard

## Thanks
Arpinux for the fonts

Malekal for the initial tuto years ago

I recently found this https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats/ , a lot of interesting tricks and inspiration (some icons too).
