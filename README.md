Awesomeconf (for awesome 3.5.1)
===========

My awesome config

Here is my personal awesomeWM config, nothing fancy. Please help yourself and copy anything you could find interesting in those files :-).


##Remarks
I use mpd, you might need to modify a little bit conky if you wish to display the playlist from another music player.

I use thunar as a file manager (change the mod + e binding if you don't use thunar).

I use xtrlock

I use URXVT as terminal.

I use wicd and htop, it spawns at restart of awesome.

And of course I use Vim (emacs lovers should change the default editor).

This theme is still under developpement, it is planed to mostrly remove conky

## INSTALL :
copy themes/ icons/ rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome

copy font to ~/.fonts

copy .conkyrc to ~/

if you want to use "alt" instead of "super/windows" you shall modify Mod4 to Mod1

if you don't have a Debian based distribution, you will need to remove all the occurences of "debian menu"

the same goes for conky and wicd

I make an extensive of MPD in the theme

finally you might want to remove my personal binds such as the xtrlock one and the layout keyboard

## Thanks
Arpinux for the fonts

Malekal for the initial tuto years ago
