My awesome config

Here is my personal awesomeWM config, nothing fancy. Please help yourself and copy anything you could find interesting in those files :-).



## INSTALL :
copy themes/ icons/ rc.lua to ~/.config/awesome
copy font to ~/.fonts

Arpinux for the fonts
Malekal for the initial tuto years ago
